This is a personal website built using the Hack4Impact Starter Pack!
I'm from Long Beach, California. I'm a 2nd year Computer Engineering major and a cool fun fact about me is that I've had 12 different hair colors before. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, cooking, and going to concerts!
